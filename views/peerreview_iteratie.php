                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In our group, we did a peer review where we looked at each other's work and gave helpful feedback. We wanted to see what was good about our projects and how we could make them even better. By sharing our thoughts and ideas, we wanted to help each other improve. This peer review created a friendly and supportive atmosphere in our group.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>What is the value of conducting a peer review in a group project?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                        During our peer review process, we created a Google Form where we could grade each person individually on different topics. We looked at things like the quality of their work, how well it was organized, and how much they contributed. This helped us give fair evaluations and feedback to each other. Using the Google Form made it easy for us to collect and review everyone's feedback.
                            <br /><br />
                            I used the CMD method called "peer review" in our project. I chose it because I wanted to get helpful feedback from my group members. Peer review helped us look at each other's work in a fair way. It let us see what we did well and what we could improve. This made our project better overall.
