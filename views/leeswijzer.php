            <h3 class="c-spacer" id="individual">Individual Project</h3>
            <h5>Assignment</h5>
            <p>For this assignment, I aim to create a new portfolio that builds upon the foundation of my previous
              portfolio. Drawing inspiration from my previous work, I seek to optimize and improve the design,
              functionality, and overall user experience. By critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of my
              old portfolio, I will implement enhancements such as a more intuitive navigation, responsive layout, and
              refined visual aesthetics to showcase my skills and accomplishments effectively.</p>
            <h5>Process & Results</h5>
            <p>
              For my individual project, I have embarked on creating a new portfolio. Since my old portfolio was already
              quite good, I decided to improve it in every aspect. Therefore, I began by creating a <a class="c-link"
                target="_blank" href="projectplanportfolio_iteratie.php">projectplan</a> and researching the areas where
              I
              could enhance the user experience (UX), as documented in my <a href="uxresearch_iteratie.php"
                target="_blank">UX research</a>. From my research, I can
              conclude that the navigation can be significantly simplified, requiring fewer clicks for the user.
              Additionally, the organization of the projects was somewhat unclear, making it necessary for users to
              search more extensively.

              Based on these findings, I started creating a <a href="portfolio_iteratie.php" target="_blank">new
                design</a> to facilitate
              easier navigation on my portfolio.
              On the project page, I opted to assign a category to each project, allowing users to filter based on their
              specific search criteria.
              <br />
            <p>During the design process, I encountered several issues. Initially, I wanted to create three cards to
              navigate to different ongoing projects. However, I also had the reader's guide that needed to be placed
              somewhere. That's why I decided to separate the reader's guide since it didn't fit well among the
              projects. Not entirely satisfied with my current design, I opted for a much simpler approach.

              Once I was content with the design, I started working on the project page. This page will display all my
              products, each with a filter tag. The filter tag allows users to filter the products based on their
              preferences.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
              Before starting my project, I created a <a href="https://github.com/Thomschneider2000/Portfolio6"
                target="_blank">Git repository</a> to store all my work. Once I had completed my
              design, I began setting up a Laravel project. To make my website modular, I will be using HTML, SCSS, CSS,
              PHP, and JavaScript. I want to make my website modular so that code blocks don't need to be repeated, and
              making changes becomes easier as they only need to be made in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              While creating my new portfolio website, I didn't encounter any major issues. The only thing that was a
              bit challenging was implementing the filter for the different projects. However, after doing some
              research, I was able to figure it out quickly. After some time, I finished building my website and only
              needed to add the content to it.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>During this assignment, I faced a challenge in selecting a final design for my new portfolio. Being quite
              particular about my preferences, I found it hard to make a decision. The abundance of design choices made
              it difficult to settle on one. However, this experience taught me the importance of finding a balance
              between my high standards and practicality to create a visually pleasing and functional portfolio.</p>

            <!-- group project -->
            <h3 class="c-spacer" id="group">Group Project</h3>
            <h5>Assignment</h5>
            <p> For our group project, we received a task from PSV to come up with an innovative way to engage
              supporters
              more with the match experience at the stadium. The assignment we received is quite broad, which is
              actually nice.</p>
            <h5>Process & Results</h5>
            <p>
              After some brainstorming, we had the idea to create an app. However, since a previous group
              had already done something similar, we wanted to take on their project and improve it.

              In the app, users can place virtual bets to earn points. Currently, these points have no purpose. Our plan
              is to incorporate more gamification elements so that users can collect and spend these points. By using a
              more visual approach to betting, we aim to attract users and make the games more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
              For our project we utilized <a class="c-link" href="https://i.imgur.com/ALruTCB.png">persona's</a>, <a
                class="c-link" href="https://i.imgur.com/ALruTCB.png">user stories</a> and <a class="c-link"
                href="https://i.imgur.com/zbi6iA9.png">user journey</a> mapping techniques to understand user needs.
              User stories captured specific features from the user's perspective, guiding development priorities. User
              journey mapping visualized the user's experience, highlighting pain points and areas for improvement.
              These approaches ensured a user-centric development process.
            </p>
            <p>
              After establishing the persona's and user journey, we began drafting a list of specifications that would
              serve as a
              guideline for the development of our app. These <a href="#">requirements</a> encompassed the key
              functionalities and
              features we wanted to incorporate into our app. By formulating these requirements, we were able to gain a
              clear understanding of what was necessary to create a successful and functional app.

              With the requirement list in mind, we proceeded to design the various betting options within the app. Our
              focus was on creating appealing and intuitive designs that would engage users and enable them to easily
              and enjoyably participate in bets.

              Throughout the design process, we took into consideration various aspects such as user-friendliness,
              visual appeal, and navigational ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this stage of the project, I started working on implementing our design. To begin with, I set up a
              <a href="">git repository</a> and created multiple branches so that my team can collaborate without
              encountering conflicts. Once the team members have pushed their changes to their respective branches, they
              can request to push their modifications to the main branch, which I need to approve.

              Furthermore, for the app, we wanted to create a web app concept, so we developed it using HTML, SCSS, and
              JavaScript. We also ensured code optimization by including various layouts, eliminating the need to repeat
              them for each page.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>During the development of the app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I found the process to be
              relatively straightforward. However, one challenge arose when multiple team members worked on different
              branches. It was crucial to maintain consistent styling throughout the app, which initially posed a slight
              issue. Fortunately, we were able to address this concern swiftly by implementing effective communication
              and collaborative decision-making, ensuring a cohesive and uniform design across all branches. This
              experience reinforced the significance of teamwork and effective coordination in achieving a unified and
              visually appealing final product.</p>

            <h5>Assignment</h5>
            <p>
              I would like to take you through my report on my participation in an international school
              project. The project was a fun experience where I had the opportunity to collaborate with students from
              different countries and cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this report, I will take you through the process of our assignment, where we were tasked with devising
              a new, innovative 15th game aimed at promoting physical activity among children on the school playground.
            </p>
            <h5>Process & Results</h5>
            <p>
              To start off, we conducted research to explore innovative ideas for our project. This led us to the
              concept of creating a tag game where users navigate from point A to point B. By collecting points through
              back-and-forth movement, players can climb the leaderboard. Before diving into the project, we thoroughly
              <a href="#">researched different tags</a> that users can employ. Additionally, I created a <a
                href="#">comparison table</a> to determine the most suitable tag for our specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, I took on the task of creating <a href="video_iteratie.php">a logo</a> for our concept,
              which we later incorporated into our project. Furthermore, I played a significant role in producing the
              video presentation for the participants of the international week. These contributions allowed me to
              showcase my creativity and actively engage with the project's visual elements, enhancing the overall
              impact and cohesiveness of our work.</p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>Being a part of the international week was a lot of fun! I had a great time connecting with people from
              different countries and cultures. It was exciting to learn from them and share ideas. The experience was
              enriching and gave me a broader perspective. I made wonderful memories and enjoyed the lively and
              enjoyable atmosphere throughout the event. It was truly an amazing and enjoyable experience to be a part
              of the international week.</p>
