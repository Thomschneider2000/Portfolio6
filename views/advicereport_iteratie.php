                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In our project, we created an advice/handover document to provide guidance and information to others who will continue our work. This document serves as a valuable resource, offering recommendations, insights, and instructions for the smooth transition and ongoing maintenance of the project. Its purpose is to ensure a seamless handover and support future endeavors.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>Why is it important to create a helpful document to guide others and pass on important information when we finish our project?</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                        While making the advice/handover report, our main goal was to give helpful guidance to others. We looked at different parts of the project and decided where advice was needed. We shared our suggestions on business matters and testing procedures. We made sure to use simple language and organized the information well. Our report ended up being a clear and useful document that helped pass on our knowledge and make the project transition easier.
                            <br /><br />
                            For creating the handover document, I used two CMD methods: "proof of concept" and "product quality review." With the "proof of concept" method, I tested and demonstrated the feasibility of ideas before implementing them. This ensured that the recommendations in the document were practical and achievable. Additionally, the "product quality review" method helped me assess the overall quality of the project and identify areas that needed improvement. These methods helped me create a reliable and effective handover document.
