                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As part of the international project, I had the opportunity to contribute my creative skills
                            by designing the project's logo. With careful consideration of its visual representation, I
                            aimed to capture the essence of the project's goals and aspirations. Additionally, I played
                            a role in creating engaging video content to promote the project worldwide.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>How did my involvement in creating the logo and contributing to the project's video content
                            enhance the impact and reach of the international project?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>In the process of creating the logo and contributing to the project's video content for the international project, several steps were involved. For the logo, I conducted thorough research on the project's theme, objectives, and target audience. With a clear understanding, I generated ideas and sketched various concepts. After selecting the most promising concept, I digitized and finalized the logo design, paying attention to color choice, typography, and overall visual appeal.
                            <br /><br />
                            Simultaneously, I collaborated with my team to develop a creative brief and storyboard for the project's video content. We identified key messages and visuals to effectively convey the project's purpose and impact. Filming and editing took place, incorporating engaging visuals, compelling storytelling, and captivating music or narration.
                            <br /><br />
                            In addition to the logo and video content, our group collaborated on creating a visually engaging poster for the international project. We took it a step further by featuring personalized avatars of each team member on the poster. By incorporating our avatars, we added a touch of personality and a sense of unity to the visual representation of the project. 
                            <br /><br />
                            As part of our international project, I applied CMD methods to ensure its success. Firstly, I conducted a pitch session to present and gather feedback on the video concept. To validate the functionality and performance of our project, I conducted field trials, seeking validation from real-world scenarios. Moreover, I employed the concept method to explore innovative ideas and refine our project's design and features. By combining these CMD methods, we were able to enhance the project's effectiveness and create a more impactful final outcome.
