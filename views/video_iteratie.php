                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As part of the international project, I had the opportunity to contribute my creative skills
                            by designing the project's logo. With careful consideration of its visual representation, I
                            aimed to capture the essence of the project's goals and aspirations. Additionally, I played
                            a role in creating engaging video content to promote the project worldwide.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>How did my involvement in creating the logo and contributing to the project's video content
                            enhance the impact and reach of the international project?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>The process of creating the logo and contributing to the project's video content for the
                            international project involved several steps.

                            For the logo, I began by researching the project's theme, objectives, and target audience.
                            With a clear understanding, I brainstormed ideas and sketched out different concepts.
                            Refining the chosen concept, I then proceeded to digitize and finalize the logo design,
                            paying attention to color selection, typography, and overall visual appeal.
                            <br /><br />
                            In parallel, for the project's video content, I collaborated with the team to develop a
                            creative brief and storyboard. We identified key messages and visuals to effectively
                            communicate the project's purpose and impact. Filming and editing were carried out,
                            incorporating engaging visuals, compelling storytelling, and captivating music or narration.
                            <br /><br />
                            Throughout the process, feedback and revisions were sought from stakeholders to ensure
                            alignment with the project's vision and goals. The final deliverables, both the logo and
                            video content, were produced, ready to create a strong brand presence and promote the
                            international project to a global audience.
