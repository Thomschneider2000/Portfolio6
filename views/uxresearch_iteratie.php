                        <p>In this document, I will conduct research on how to make my old portfolio more user-friendly.
                            I will also explore ways to use my code more efficiently. I aim to undertake this research
                            in order to design my portfolio in a more user-friendly manner based on the obtained
                            results.</p>

                            efficiently?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>In order to improve my old portfolio, I undertook a comprehensive research project focused on
                            UX and UI design. Recognizing the significance of creating a user-friendly and visually
                            appealing portfolio, I delved into various aspects of UX and UI design principles.

                            To initiate the research, I extensively studied user behavior and preferences when
                            interacting with online portfolios. This involved analyzing case studies, examining
                            successful portfolio designs, and studying user feedback and reviews. By understanding what
                            users expect and appreciate in a portfolio, I gained valuable insights into the key elements
                            that contribute to a positive user experience.
                            <br /><br />
                            Next, I explored UI design techniques and trends to enhance the visual aesthetics of my
                            portfolio. I researched color typography, layout design, and the effective use of visual
                            elements such as images and icons with the assistance of <a class="c-link"
                                href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a>. By incorporating these design
                            principles, I aimed to create an engaging and visually cohesive interface that would
                            captivate the attention of visitors.

                        <p>In conclusion, the research I conducted on UX and UI design has been instrumental in guiding
                            me towards enhancing my old portfolio. By incorporating user-centered design principles and
                            employing effective visual aesthetics, I am on track to create a more engaging,
                            user-friendly, and visually appealing portfolio that effectively showcases my work.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>The research on UX and UI design for my old portfolio has been an enlightening journey. It
                            deepened my understanding of user experience, visual aesthetics, and usability. By studying
                            user behavior and preferences, exploring design principles, and conducting usability tests,
                            I gained valuable insights into creating a more engaging and user-friendly portfolio.</p>

                        <p>The next step in the project is to bring the design of my new portfolio to life. I will begin
                            by converting the wireframes and prototypes into actual web pages, carefully implementing
                            the visual elements, navigation, and user interface components. Through coding and
                            development, I will ensure that the design is accurately translated into a fully functional
                            and visually appealing portfolio.</p>
