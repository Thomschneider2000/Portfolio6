                        <p>As a group, we embark on a project to develop an impactful project plan for PSV. Our focus is
                            to enhance the engagement with fans in the stands, creating an electric atmosphere that
                            unites and captivates supporters, forging a stronger bond between the club and its dedicated
                            followers.</p>

                        <p>How can we improve the interactivity with supporters in the stands for the Football Club PSV.

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our collaborative process for creating a project plan for the PSV project began with a
                            thorough understanding of the project's objectives and scope. We conducted extensive
                            research, exploring the latest fan engagement techniques. Through productive brainstorming
                            sessions, we generated innovative ideas that were carefully evaluated for feasibility and
                            potential impact. Building upon this, we meticulously developed a comprehensive plan,
                            defining timelines, tasks, and responsibilities in detail. Throughout the process, we
                            actively sought and incorporated regular stakeholder feedback, refining and optimizing the
                            plan. Finally, we presented the well-crafted project plan for approval, incorporating all
                            the valuable insights gained along the way.
                            <br /><br />
                            In addition, we created user stories for our project to capture the needs and expectations
                            of our users. These stories guided our development process, ensuring that we delivered a
                            product that met their requirements. I also took the initiative to create a <a class="c-link" href="https://trello.com/b/ogvDSdI1/advanced-media-psv">Trello board</a> and
                            diligently served as the Scrum Master, ensuring its continuous updates.
                            <br /><br />
                            I used the CMD Methods Pack, specifically the requirement list. I used this method to
                            outline all the needs and specifications of my project. I identified the features,
                            performance criteria, and other important elements required to successfully complete the
                            project. By using the requirement list, I had a clear overview of what was necessary and
                            could steer my development process more efficiently. It helped me understand the project
                            goals and ensure that the project met all the set requirements.
