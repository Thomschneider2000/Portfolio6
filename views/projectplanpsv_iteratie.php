                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our collaborative process for creating a project plan for the PSV project begins with a deep
                            understanding of the project's objectives and scope. We then delve into extensive research,
                            exploring the latest fan engagement techniques. Through productive brainstorming sessions,
                            we generate innovative ideas that are carefully evaluated for feasibility and potential
                            impact. Building upon this, we meticulously develop a comprehensive plan, meticulously
                            defining timelines, tasks, and responsibilities. Throughout the process, we actively seek
                            and incorporate regular stakeholder feedback, ensuring the plan is refined and optimized.
                            Finally, we present the well-crafted project plan for approval, incorporating all the
                            valuable insights gained along the way.
                            <br /><br />
                            We also created user stories for our project to capture the needs and expectations of our
                            users. These stories will guide our development process and ensure that we deliver a product
                            that meets their requirements.
