                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>I built my portfolio website using HTML, SCSS, JS, and PHP. These tools helped me create an
                            attractive and interactive platform to display my skills, projects, and achievements.
                            Visitors can easily explore and interact with my work on the website.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            While creating my portfolio, I used HTML, SCSS, JS, and PHP to make an engaging and dynamic
                            website. PHP helped me build different parts of the layout and generate content dynamically,
                            giving my portfolio a consistent design.
                            <br /><br />
                            To keep track of my work, I used Git, a tool that saved my progress at different stages.
                            Throughout the coding process, I focused on writing clean and manageable code, following
                            best practices for organization and structure. This ensured that my portfolio was easy to
                            maintain and could be expanded in the future.
                            <br /><br />
                            For this part, I employed the co-creation method from the CMD Methods Pack and utilized
                            prototyping. Through co-creation, I collaborated with others to generate ideas and solutions
                            collectively, benefitting from diverse perspectives. This approach fostered innovation and
                            ensured that the end result addressed various needs effectively. Additionally, I created
                            prototypes, which allowed me to visualize and test ideas before final implementation.
                            Prototyping helped identify potential improvements and resolve any issues early on, leading
                            to a more refined and user-centered solution for the project.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In conclusion, coding my portfolio was a great achievement. I focused on writing clean and
                            organized code, which made it easier to maintain and update in the future. By using HTML,
                            SCSS, JS, and PHP, I created a visually appealing and interactive website. The dynamic
                            features made the portfolio more engaging for visitors. Overall, this project showcased my
                            skills and provided a professional online presence.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Initially, I found PHP to be quite challenging when coding my portfolio. The syntax and
                            concepts were unfamiliar, and I struggled to grasp its functionality. However, with
                            perseverance and practice, I gradually gained a better understanding of PHP. Over time, I
                            became more comfortable and confident in utilizing it to create dynamic and interactive
                            elements within my portfolio, leading to a sense of accomplishment and growth.</p>

                        <p>The next step in my portfolio development journey is to populate it with content. I will
                            carefully curate and showcase my projects, skills, and experiences to demonstrate my
                            abilities and expertise. This involves selecting and organizing relevant information,
                            creating engaging descriptions, and presenting my work in a visually appealing manner. By
                            doing so, I will create a compelling and informative portfolio that effectively highlights
                            my talents.</p>
