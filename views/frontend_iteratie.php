                        <p>How can i create a webapp using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and PHP?</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>I began the implementation of our design in this phase of the project. To ensure smooth
                            collaboration within my team, I established a git repository and created multiple branches,
                            preventing any conflicts. After team members push their changes to their respective
                            branches, they can request to merge their modifications into the main branch, which requires
                            my approval.

                            Moreover, for the app, our goal was to create a web application using HTML, SCSS, and
                            JavaScript. To enhance efficiency, we implemented different layouts, eliminating the need to
                            duplicate them for every page.

                            Given my existing familiarity with PHP, working with it was a straightforward process.
                            Leveraging my PHP expertise, I successfully implemented several features that improved the
                            functionality and efficiency of the project. One notable accomplishment was establishing a
                            centralized menu system that remains consistent across all pages. By consolidating the menu
                            code into a single file, updates and modifications became much more manageable, saving time
                            and effort.
                            <br /><br />
                            Furthermore, I delved into JavaScript to enhance the user experience and add interactive
                            elements to the web application. Through JavaScript, I implemented dynamic functionalities
                            such as activating specific buttons based on user interactions and triggering engaging
                            animations. These additions not only elevated the overall interactivity of the application
                            but also enhanced its visual appeal.
                            <br /><br />
                            I applied the CMD methods such as prototyping and proof of concept to create the PSV web app
                            using. Simultaneously, I conducted A/B testing with a few members of my project group to
                            gather insights and enhance the app's performance.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>I effectively implemented the code for the PSV project, leveraging my expertise in HTML,
                            SCSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Through efficient version control and collaboration with my team,
                            I ensured smooth development. By optimizing the code, integrating a consistent menu, and
                            enhancing interactivity, I successfully delivered a functional and user-friendly web
                            application.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Realizing the code for the PSV project was a rewarding experience. I confidently applied my
                            skills in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and PHP to bring the project to life. Through effective
                            teamwork and optimization, I successfully delivered a functional web application that meets
                            the project's requirements. The only thing that took some getting used to was picking up PHP
                            again after not working with it for a while.</p>

                        <p>The next step in the project involves conducting user testing for the web application. This
                            process will involve gathering feedback from users to evaluate the functionality, usability,
                            and overall user experience of the web app, allowing for necessary refinements and
                            improvements to be made.</p>
