                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>I am going to write a project plan to provide a structured approach for the project I am
                            going to execute. The project plan will describe the objectives, scope, planning, resources,
                            and approach of the project. This will give me a clear understanding of what needs to be
                            achieved, which steps need to be taken, and what resources are required.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            In creating a project plan for my portfolio project to optimize my old portfolio, I followed
                            these steps. First, I conducted a thorough assessment of my current portfolio, analyzing its
                            strengths and weaknesses. Next, I defined clear objectives for the project, outlining the
                            specific improvements I wanted to make. Then, I researched best practices and industry
                            trends to gather inspiration and insights. Based on this research, I developed a detailed
                            plan that included tasks, timelines, and resources needed. Regular evaluation and feedback
                            ensured the successful optimization of my portfolio.
                            <br /><br />
                            I used two methods from the CMD Methods Pack, benchmark creation and
                            requirement list. With benchmark creation, I compared my project to other examples and
                            standards to see how it performed. This provided me with valuable insights and ideas for
                            improvement. Additionally, I used the requirement list to clarify all the necessary
                            specifications and requirements for my project. This helped me understand exactly what I
                            needed and enabled me to successfully complete my project.

                        <p>In conclusion, the research I conducted on UX and UI design has been instrumental in guiding
                            me towards enhancing my old portfolio. By incorporating user-centered design principles and
                            employing effective visual aesthetics, I am on track to create a more engaging,
                            user-friendly, and visually appealing portfolio that effectively showcases my work.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>The research on UX and UI design for my old portfolio has been an enlightening journey. It
                            deepened my understanding of user experience, visual aesthetics, and usability. By studying
                            user behavior and preferences, exploring design principles, and conducting usability tests,
                            I gained valuable insights into creating a more engaging and user-friendly portfolio.</p>

                        <p>The next step in the project is to bring the design of my new portfolio to life. I will begin
                            by converting the wireframes and prototypes into actual web pages, carefully implementing
                            the visual elements, navigation, and user interface components. Through coding and
                            development, I will ensure that the design is accurately translated into a fully functional
                            and visually appealing portfolio.</p>
