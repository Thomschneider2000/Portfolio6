                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As stakeholders in the SmartMobile class, our group holds a critical role in providing
                            feedback and overseeing the progress of the students' work. The group is also working on
                            various components for our PSV project, which involves the implementation of specific
                            features. These features are designed to enhance the overall functionality and user
                            experience of the project. Our group collaboratively contributes to brainstorming and
                            implementing these features, ensuring that they align with the project goals and
                            requirements.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>How can we provide effective and valuable feedback to the students who are developing
                            features for our project?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>The feedback process involves the students presenting their work every Wednesday, and our
                            group providing feedback on the three SmartMobile groups.

                            During the presentations, the students showcase their progress, demonstrate the implemented
                            features, and explain their design choices. We actively listen and observe their
                            presentations, paying close attention to the functionality, user interface, and adherence to
                            project requirements.
                            <br /><br />
                            Following the presentations, we engage in constructive discussions with each group,
                            addressing both the strengths and areas for improvement. We provide specific feedback on the
                            effectiveness of the implemented features, the quality of the code, and the overall user
                            experience. Our feedback focuses on highlighting what worked well and suggesting actionable
                            recommendations for enhancements.
                            <br /><br />
                            Throughout the process, we maintain open lines of communication with the students,
                            encouraging them to ask questions and seek clarification on the feedback provided. This
                            interaction fosters a collaborative learning environment where the students can grow and
                            refine their skills.

                        <p>The feedback process for the SmartMobile groups has been instrumental in guiding and
                            supporting the students' feature development. By actively engaging in presentations,
                            providing constructive feedback, and maintaining open communication, we foster a
                            collaborative learning environment that drives continuous improvement and project success.

                        <p>Reflecting on the feedback process for the SmartMobile groups, I have gained valuable
                            insights and honed my skills as a stakeholder. Engaging in presentations, providing
                            constructive feedback, and maintaining open communication not only benefited the students
                            but also expanded my own knowledge and understanding of the project development process.</p>

                        <p>The next step is conducting a final evaluation to assess the overall success of the project.
                            This involves reviewing the project's outcomes, evaluating its adherence to requirements,
                            and gathering feedback from stakeholders and users to identify areas of improvement and
                            lessons learned.</p>
