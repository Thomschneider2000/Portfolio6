                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In our application development process, we utilized the C4 model to provide a clear and visual representation of the system architecture. This model was employed to communicate and document the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure of our application, facilitating effective design and collaboration.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>Why did we use the C4 model for our application and how does it help us design and work together better?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>In creating the C4 model for our app, We followed a step-by-step process. First, We identified the main components and their relationships, representing them in the initial levels of the model. Then, I focused on the 4th level, where I described how the progression works within the app. I examined the different stages and steps that users go through, from getting the current xp to using the app's features and progressing further. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            For creating the C4 model, I used the following CMD methods: literature study and prototyping. Firstly, I conducted a literature study, searching online to enhance my understanding of C4 modeling techniques. This research allowed me to gather valuable insights and knowledge. Secondly, I employed prototyping to visually represent the components and relationships of the app in the C4 model. This iterative process helped me refine and improve the model's design and functionality.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>We chose to use the C4 model for our application because it offers a clear and systematic approach to visualizing and communicating the architecture of our system. By using the C4 model, we were able to effectively design and collaborate on the different levels of our application, including the progression system. The model helped us understand the relationships between components, identify potential issues, and ensure a cohesive and well-structured design, ultimately enhancing our teamwork and decision-making process.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Reflecting on the process, I initially found it challenging to create and visualize the C4 model for our application. Understanding the relationships between components and effectively representing them in the model required careful analysis and consideration. However, with persistence and support from my team, I gradually gained confidence and improved my ability to create the model. It was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to enhance my visualization skills and appreciate the benefits of using the C4 model in our application development process.

                        <p>The next step in the process is to begin developing the app based on the insights and design principles derived from the C4 model. We will start by translating the components and relationships identified in the model into actual code and functionality. This involves implementing the features, designing the user interface, and ensuring that the app aligns with the intended user experience and goals.</p>
