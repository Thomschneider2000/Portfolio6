                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>This document presents an evaluation of our product based on valuable feedback provided by
                            our stakeholders. The stakeholders actively tested our product and shared their
                            observations, suggestions, and concerns. Their insights play a crucial role in driving
                            improvements and enhancing the overall quality of our offering. This document aims to
                            summarize their feedback and outline the key areas for consideration and refinement.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>How can we use the feedback from stakeholders to make our product better and provide a great
                            user experience?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this document, I conducted an analysis of stakeholder feedback, outlined their testing
                            steps, and proposed improvements for the future. Gathering feedback on our product's
                            functionality and user experience, I carefully examined suggestions and concerns to identify
                            strengths and areas for improvement.
                            <br /><br />
                            Describing the stakeholder's testing process, including accessing the product, performing
                            tasks, and evaluating results, I provided a detailed overview of the testing journey and the
                            insights gained.
                            <br /><br />
                            To enhance stakeholder feedback, I suggested implementing a structured feedback collection
                            method, establishing clear guidelines, and actively listening to their needs and
                            suggestions. By incorporating these enhancements, we aim to foster improved collaboration
                            and optimize our products for the future.
                            <br /><br />
                            I have created this document using the CMD Method Research approach, employing observation,
                            usability testing, and co-creation. These methods were chosen for their ability to provide
                            valuable insights into user behavior and needs. Observation allows us to observe users in
                            their natural environment, while usability testing helps evaluate the usability of the
                            product. Co-creation enables us to directly obtain input and ideas from stakeholders,
                            facilitating collaborative improvements.

                        <p>The analysis of stakeholder feedback and the description of their testing steps have provided
                            valuable insights for improving our product. By implementing the suggested improvements and
                            actively seeking stakeholder input, we can enhance our offerings and ensure a more
                            collaborative and user-centric approach in the future.</p>

                        <p>During the analysis of stakeholder feedback and documentation of their testing steps, I found
                            it fascinating to witness the varying ways in which different users interacted with our app.
                            It was intriguing to see how certain individuals approached and utilized the features in
                            ways we hadn't anticipated, providing valuable insights into user behavior and potential
                            improvements.</p>

                            step is to prioritize and address the identified areas for improvement. We will allocate
                            resources and implement necessary fixes and enhancements to ensure an enhanced user
