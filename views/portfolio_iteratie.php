                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In this document, I would like to explain the iterations and design choices I have made.
                            Throughout the development process, I have gone through multiple iterations, constantly
                            evaluating and making improvements based on feedback and user testing.</p>

                        <h2>Main question</h2>
                        <p>How can I optimize my portfolio design based on my previous research?</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>The process of developing my personal portfolio involved <a class="c-link" href="">multiple
                                iterations</a> to ensure its optimal presentation. Each iteration involved a series of
                            steps, including planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating. Throughout this process,
                            I made several design choices based on their effectiveness in enhancing the portfolio's
                            overall appeal and user experience.
                            <br /><br />
                            One design choice I made was to use a clean and minimalist layout. This decision was
                            influenced by the research I conducted, which indicated that a clutter-free design helps to
                            showcase the content more effectively and creates a professional impression. By utilizing
                            ample white space and a balanced composition, I aimed to create a visually pleasing and
                            easily navigable portfolio.
                            <br /><br />
                            In terms of typography, I chose fonts that were legible and reflected the overall tone and
                            style of my portfolio. By using a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts, I aimed to
                            create a visually appealing hierarchy and enhance readability.

                        <p>In conclusion, the iterative development process for my personal portfolio allowed me to
                            optimize its design and user experience. Through research and thoughtful design choices,
                            such as a clean layout, consistent color scheme, responsive design, and legible typography,
                            I created an impactful and visually appealing portfolio.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Reflecting on the process, optimizing my personal portfolio proved to be a valuable learning
                            experience. While research and design choices played key roles, I encountered challenges due
                            to my perfectionistic tendencies. Striking the right balance and making design decisions was
                            difficult, but ultimately, I achieved an impressive and visually pleasing portfolio.</p>

                        <p>The next step involves translating the finalized design into code. By leveraging my
                            programming skills and utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will meticulously implement
                            the design elements, ensuring accuracy and attention to detail. This coding phase is crucial
                            in bringing the visual concept to life and creating a functional website.</p>
