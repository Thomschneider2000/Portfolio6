                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I aim to explore the functionalities and applications of NFC tags, RFID
                            tags, and Bluetooth technology. These wireless communication technologies offer diverse
                            possibilities in various industries, including retail, logistics, and healthcare. By delving
                            into their capabilities, advantages, and limitations, we can uncover innovative ways to
                            harness their potential for seamless data transfer, tracking, and interaction.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>I conducted a thorough research on NFC tags, RFID tags, and Bluetooth tags to create a comprehensive comparison chart. I gathered relevant information about their features, capabilities, and limitations. Key criteria, including range, data transfer speed, power requirements, compatibility, and cost, were identified and analyzed. By contrasting these factors, I created a structured chart that highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each tag type. The chart provided stakeholders with valuable insights for informed decision-making.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I used the CMD methods "comparison chart" to compare RFID tags, NFC tags, and Bluetooth tags. Additionally, I conducted a literature study on this topic. These activities helped me gain insights into their functionalities and applications.

                        <p>After conducting a comparison of NFC tags, RFID tags, and Bluetooth tags, it is evident that
                            RFID tags are the most suitable choice for our project. With their extended range, robust
                            data transfer capabilities, and compatibility with various systems, RFID tags offer the
                            ideal solution for our specific requirements. Their versatility and reliability make them
                            the optimal choice for seamless tracking and interaction.</p>

                        <p>The next step in the project is to brainstorm and outline the project plan. This includes
                            defining the objectives, target audience, and desired outcomes. Additionally, I will create
                            a script for the video we need to deliver, outlining the key messages, visuals, and overall
                            structure to effectively communicate the project's purpose and findings.</p>
