            <!-- individual project -->
            <h3 id="individual">Individual Project</h3>
            <p>
              For my individual project, I have embarked on creating a new portfolio. Since my old portfolio was already
              quite good, I decided to improve it in every aspect. Therefore, I began by researching the areas where I
              could enhance the user experience (UX), as documented in my <a
                href="assets/pdf/ux onderzoek portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">UX research</a>. From my research, I can
              conclude that the navigation can be significantly simplified, requiring fewer clicks for the user.
              Additionally, the organization of the projects was somewhat unclear, making it necessary for users to
              search more extensively.

              Based on these findings, I started creating a <a href="#" target="_blank">new design</a> to facilitate
              easier navigation on my portfolio.
              On the project page, I opted to assign a category to each project, allowing users to filter based on their
              specific search criteria.
              <br />
            <p>During the design process, I encountered several issues. Initially, I wanted to create three cards to
              navigate to different ongoing projects. However, I also had the reader's guide that needed to be placed
              somewhere. That's why I decided to separate the reader's guide since it didn't fit well among the
              projects. Not entirely satisfied with my current design, I opted for a much simpler approach.

              Once I was content with the design, I started working on the project page. This page will display all my
              products, each with a filter tag. The filter tag allows users to filter the products based on their
              preferences.</p>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Before starting my project, I created a <a href="https://github.com/Thomschneider2000/Portfolio6"
                target="_blank">Git repository</a> to store all my work. Once I had completed my
              design, I began setting up a Laravel project. To make my website modular, I will be using HTML, SCSS, CSS,
              PHP, and JavaScript. I want to make my website modular so that code blocks don't need to be repeated, and
              making changes becomes easier as they only need to be made in one place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While creating my new portfolio website, I didn't encounter any major issues. The only thing that was a
              bit challenging was implementing the filter for the different projects. However, after doing some
              research, I was able to figure it out quickly. After some time, I finished building my website and only
              needed to add the content to it.

            <h3 id="group">Group Project</h3>
            <p>
              For our group project, we received a task from PSV to come up with an innovative way to engage supporters
              more with the match experience at the stadium. The assignment we received is quite broad, which is
              actually nice. After some brainstorming, we had the idea to create an app. However, since a previous group
              had already done something similar, we wanted to take on their project and improve it.

              In the app, users can place virtual bets to earn points. Currently, these points have no purpose. Our plan
              is to incorporate more gamification elements so that users can collect and spend these points. By using a
              more visual approach to betting, we aim to attract users and make the games more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After establishing the requirements, we began drafting a list of specifications that would serve as a
              guideline for the development of our app. These requirements encompassed the key functionalities and
              features we wanted to incorporate into our app. By formulating these requirements, we were able to gain a
              clear understanding of what was necessary to create a successful and functional app.

              With the requirement list in mind, we proceeded to design the various betting options within the app. Our
              focus was on creating appealing and intuitive designs that would engage users and enable them to easily
              and enjoyably participate in bets.

              Throughout the design process, we took into consideration various aspects such as user-friendliness,
              visual appeal, and navigational ease.
